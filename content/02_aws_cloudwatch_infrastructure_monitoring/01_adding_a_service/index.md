## Adding A Service

One of our teams have just migrated their application to AWS. This application includes invocations to AWS SQS, currently not being monitored in Dynatrace. Add the AWS SQS services to be monitored in Dynatrace. 

1. Access to Dynatrace UI
2. Click on Setting, on the left Menu 
3. Expand the "Cloud and virtualization" section
4. Select AWS
5. Edit (pencil icon) the current AWS connection
6. Click on Manage Services
7. Add a new Service
8. Search the SQS service and click on Add Service
- Note: Don’t save it, as you don’t have the permissions to add it
