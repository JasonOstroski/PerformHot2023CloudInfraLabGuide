## Create Static Threshold Alert

While Dynatrace will automatically detect when disk space is low, a few of our app teams are noisy loggers and we want to warn them of disk space utilization earlier.
We donâ€™t want to change the OOTB Anomaly Detection as that will let us know when disk is critical. We just want an early warning alert.
