## Create an Auto-Adaptive Alert

- We sometimes get 4xx errors on the ALB and have accepted that we can’t fix 100% of errors.
- However, we want Dynatrace to tell us if errors spike up outside of the norm without having to create thresholds ourselves.
- The number of errors may fluctuate, and it would be great if Dynatrace could auto-adapt and let us know when big spikes occur
