## Alerting

### Learning Concepts
- Dynatrace provides out of the box anomaly detection for many app, service, and infrastructure problems.
- For each anomaly type, you can either select automatic detection to rely on Davis to alert you about problems, or you can provide a fixed threshold.
- You can also create your own alerts on metrics in Dynatrace
* Static Thresholds
* Auto-Adaptive Thresholds
* Seasonal Baselines
- Alerting Profiles are used to filter/group alerts
- Problem Notifications are used to send alerts or notifications when thresholds are breached or anomalies are detected.
- Dynatrace has integrations with Incident Management , ChatOps, and Service Management solutions
- Dynatrace can also send problem notifications via webhook or email
