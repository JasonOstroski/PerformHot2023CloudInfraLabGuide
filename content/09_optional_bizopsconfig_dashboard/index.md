## BizOpsConfigurator Dashboarding 
### We spent a lot of time today building dashboards, wouldn't it be cool to automated some of this?

- In the left hand, dark grey bar: Navigate to Manage > Access Token
- Click Generate Access Token
- (APIv2) Read metrics, write metrics, ingest metrics 
- (APIv1) Access problem, read config, write config, user sessions
- You will only see the token once! Save it in a safe place like a password/key manager.
