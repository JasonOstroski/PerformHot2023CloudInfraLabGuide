## Kubernetes Environment Set up

### Before we jump into K8s, we want to generate some events

1. Login to your Bastion Host through Dynatrace University
2. Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pod –n easytrade
```

3. Copy the full name of the "frontend pod" and paste it into the next command
4. Run the following command: 

```bash
kubectl delete pod frontend-xxxxxxxx-xxxx -n easytrade
```

5. Re-run the following command: 

```bash
kubectl get pod –n easytrade
```

* Make sure the pod has been recycled, by re-running step 2. Check the timestamp of the new pod. 

6. Exit the Bastion Host
